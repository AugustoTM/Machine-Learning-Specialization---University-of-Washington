# Machine Learning Specialization - University of Washington

This repository has the codes used in the Machine Learning Specialization from University of Washington, which is available on Coursera.

It is divided into 4 courses:

1. **Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach (6 Weeks)**
2. **Machine Learning: Regression (6 Weeks)**
3. **Machine Learning: Classification (7 Weeks)**
4. **Machine Learning: Clustering & Retrieval**

In each week, a Python Notebook was used to implement the weekly activity and obtain answers for the Quizzes. For this, the Turi Create package was used to achieve the results.
